Questions and concerns about the coding study

    1.  Can we get YV to use the new TPOCSA_form that I made into an excel?
    2.  Some of the TIRF's are done on the adult form, is this on purpose?
    3.  Some of the file names have an extra number in them, is this on purpose?
    4.  How many total interviews are being coded?
    5.  Some of these have "2 parts." Do we code this as two sessions?
    6.
